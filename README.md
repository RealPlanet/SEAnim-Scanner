# SEAnimScanner

This tool is intented to be used along side exported SEAnims. The main purpose is to be able to batch read anims and identify those with a specific joint(\bone) name.



# HOW TO USE
Simply drag and drop a folder containing the seanims or the seanims directly, then type one or more joint names into the top text box (if multiple joints are used the character ',' is used to separate them). When ready simply press the SCAN button and let the program work. As the tool finds animations it will move them into a folder located in the same place as the executable file.

# REQUIREMENTS
 > .NET Framework 4.7.2
 
 > Atleast 50MB of RAM.
